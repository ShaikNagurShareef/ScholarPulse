     - **Code Generator**: Creates code from scratch based on paper descriptions, asking the user for framework preferences (e.g., Python with TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).
     - **Validator**: Ensures code accuracy by cross-referencing with paper details and testing for basic functionality.

5. **User Interaction Module (ScholarSync)**
   - **Functionality**: Manages user inputs, preferences, and tailored outputs.
   - **Subcomponents**:
     - **Profile Manager**: Collects and stores user background (e.g., bachelor’s student in CS, master’s in physics) to adjust explanation complexity.
     - **Query Interface**: Provides a chat-based or Q&A interface for user questions.
     - **Feedback Loop**: Allows users to refine outputs (e.g., adjust code frameworks, clarify explanations).

6. **Memory and Data Management Module (PulseMemory)**
   - **Functionality**: Retains context across sessions for a personalized experience.
   - **Subcomponents**:
     - **Conversation Store**: Saves prior interactions and paper analyses.
     - **Data Controls**: Enables users to delete or disable memory features.

## 6. Sample Workflow
1. **User Input**: Uploads a PDF titled “Deep Learning for NLP” or provides an arXiv link.
2. **Background Check**: User specifies “Master’s student in CS.”
3. **Analysis**: ScholarPulse summarizes the paper, extracts a key LSTM model, and fetches 2 cited references.
4. **Query**: User asks, “How does the LSTM layer work?” ScholarPulse explains with a diagram (if confirmed) and examples.
5. **Code**: ScholarPulse finds no GitHub repo, asks, “Python with PyTorch or Keras?” and generates a working LSTM implementation.
6. **Output**: User downloads the code and summary, with memory saved for future reference.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Support for multimedia papers (e.g., video explanations).
- Collaborative features for research teams.
- Integration with academic platforms (e.g., Google Scholar, ResearchGate).
