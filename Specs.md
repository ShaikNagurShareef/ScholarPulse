    *   **Backend API:** Python-based API (e.g., FastAPI or Flask). Exposes RESTful endpoints for the frontend. Handles business logic, user session management (stateless preferred), orchestrates calls to other services (LLM, DBs, Task Queue).
    *   **LLM Orchestration (LangChain):** Integrated within the Backend/Workers. Uses LangChain to define agents, chains, manage prompts, interact with the Groq API, and potentially manage conversation memory.
    *   **Task Queue / Workers (e.g., Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ):** Handles long-running, asynchronous tasks like:
        *   PDF fetching and parsing.
        *   Text chunking and embedding generation.
        *   Expensive LLM analysis tasks (e.g., initial summarization).
        *   External API calls for citations and code search.
    *   **LLM Service (Groq API):** External service providing fast LLM inference capabilities accessed via API calls managed by LangChain.
    *   **Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL):** Stores user profile information (if applicable), paper metadata (title, authors, source URL/DOI, processing status), citation metadata, Q&A session history, pointers to stored files.
    *   **Vector Database (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS with index storage, Pinecone):** Stores text chunks from papers and their corresponding vector embeddings for efficient semantic search during RAG.
    *   **File Storage (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO, or local disk):** Stores uploaded PDF files.
    *   **External Services:** APIs for resolving DOIs (CrossRef), fetching citation data (CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, arXiv), and searching code (GitHub API).

*   **5.3. Technology Stack (Proposed):**
    *   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, CSS (Tailwind CSS or similar)
    *   **Backend:** Python 3.10+, FastAPI

**7. LLM Agent Design (LangChain & Groq)**

*   **Core Strategy:** Employ multiple specialized agents, orchestrated by LangChain, leveraging Groq for fast inference. Use RAG extensively for grounding.
*   **Key Agents:**
    *   **`PaperAnalyzerAgent`:**
        *   **Input:** Parsed paper text (potentially chunked).
        *   **Task:** Identify sections, extract abstract/keywords, generate initial summary, identify core theoretical basis.
        *   **Tools:** LLM (Groq).
        *   **Prompting:** Instruct the LLM to perform specific extraction and summarization tasks based on the full text or key sections.
    *   **`CitationResolverAgent`:** (Potentially part of a Worker task, not a conversational agent)
        *   **Input:** Extracted citation strings.
        *   **Task:** Format queries for external APIs (CrossRef, etc.), parse results, extract metadata.
        *   **Tools:** API Request Tools (for CrossRef, Semantic Scholar), String Parsing tools.
    *   **`ExplanationGeneratorAgent`:**
        *   **Input:** User request (topic/section), relevant paper chunks, user background profile, potentially related citation abstracts.
        *   **Task:** Generate a clear explanation tailored to the user's background.
        *   **Tools:** LLM (Groq), Vector Store Retriever (for finding relevant chunks).
        *   **Prompting:** Crucial to include user background explicitly, e.g., "Explain [topic] from the provided text, assuming the reader is a [user_background] and has no prior knowledge of X."
    *   **`QuestionAnsweringAgent (RAG)`:**
        *   **Input:** User question, conversation history.
        *   **Task:** Answer user questions based *only* on the provided paper context.
        *   **Tools:** Vector Store Retriever, LLM (Groq).
        *   **Chain Type:** RetrievalQA chain or custom RAG implementation.
        *   **Prompting:** "Based on the following context sections from the research paper, answer the question: [Question]\n\nContext:\n[Retrieved Chunks]\n\nAnswer:"
    *   **`CodeSearchAgent`:** (Potentially part of a Worker task)
        *   **Input:** Paper metadata (title, authors), paper text.
        *   **Task:** Find code repository links within the paper or via GitHub API search.
        *   **Tools:** Regex/String Search Tool (for paper text), GitHub API Search Tool.
    *   **`CodeGenerationAgent`:**
        *   **Input:** User request (description of desired code), relevant paper sections, user-specified language/frameworks.
        *   **Task:** Generate code implementing the request.
        *   **Tools:** LLM (Groq), Vector Store Retriever (to find relevant paper sections describing the method).
        *   **Prompting:** "Generate code in [Language] using the [Framework] library to implement the [Method Description] described in the following text sections. Be clear and add comments explaining the implementation.\n\nRelevant Text:\n[Retrieved Chunks]\n\nCode:" Requires careful prompt engineering and potentially iterative refinement if the first attempt is poor. *Interaction with the user for framework choice is handled by the Backend API before calling this agent.*
*   **Groq Integration:** LangChain's Groq integration will be used to provide the LLM capabilities to these agents, benefiting from low latency for interactive tasks like Q&A and Explanation.

**8. Deployment Strategy**

*   **Containerization:** Dockerize all components (Frontend, Backend API, Workers).
*   **Orchestration:** Use Docker Compose for local development and testing. For production, consider Kubernetes (e.g., EKS, GKE, AKS) or simpler PaaS solutions (AWS App Runner, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps, Railway, Render).
*   **Infrastructure:**
    *   Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) for hosting services, databases, and storage.
    *   Managed database services (e.g., AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, managed Vector DB if not self-hosting ChromaDB).
    *   Managed Cache/Broker (e.g., AWS ElastiCache for Redis).
    *   Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3).
*   **CI/CD:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) for automated testing, building Docker images, and deploying updates.

**9. Future Enhancements**

*   **V1.1:** User accounts and persistent paper libraries.
*   **V1.2:** Enhanced citation analysis (e.g., building citation graphs, summarizing impact of cited works).
*   **V1.3:** Visualizations (e.g., concept maps, simplified figure explanations).
*   **V1.4:** Support for comparing multiple papers.
*   **V2.0:** Deeper code analysis (e.g., static analysis of generated code, linking code blocks to paper sections).
*   **V2.1:** Integration with Zotero/Mendeley APIs.
*   **V2.2:** Collaborative features for teams working on papers.
*   **V2.3:** Support for other document types (e.g., theses, technical reports).
